I value both efficiency and a positive user-experience and am always willing to explore new methods, practices, and ideas to ensure these two conditions are met. In past work and personal experiences I have come to witness how technology can greatly improve systems and processes no matter how simple or complex. At the core, this is what keeps me coming back - the ability to help people.I understand the impact and power of technology and feel strongly about making it more accessible.
